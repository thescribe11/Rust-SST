Super Star Trek - In Rust

**Note: I'm still working on developing this. As of 8/05/2021 the game is not yet playable.**

Created in 1971 by Mike Mayfield, Super Star Trek is a classic computer game, being heralded in 1980 as "one of the most popular (if not the most popular) games around." At one point Apple even developed an "official" version called *Apple Trek*. Unfortunately, it has gotten somewhat long in the tooth since then. As a result, I have decided to develop my own version.
